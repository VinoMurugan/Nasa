# NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) Project

This is my second project, built using React, where I aim to fetch and display the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD). Below, I'll briefly describe the project and my experiences.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a React application that allows users to view the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) from NASA. The APOD is a collection of images, videos, and other multimedia files related to space, astronomy, and astrophysics, provided by NASA.

## Project Features

- Users can enter a specific date (in the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format) to view the APOD for that date.
- The application fetches the APOD data from NASA's API and displays the image, along with its title and explanation.

## Challenges Faced

### Fetching the API Key

One of the initial challenges I faced was fetching the API key from NASA's API portal. Here are the steps I followed:

1. I signed up for an account on NASA's API portal (https://api.nasa.gov/).
2. After creating an account, I generated an API key.
3. I learned how to include this API key in my code to make authorized requests to the NASA APOD API.

### Learning React

This project also provided me with an opportunity to further my understanding of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. While working on this project, I:

- Set up a React project using Create React App.
- Created React components to structure the application.
- Used React hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`, for managing state and fetching data.
- Learned how to pass data between components in a React application.

## Project Setup

To run this project locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your NASA API key by signing up on NASA's API portal (https://api.nasa.gov/).
3. Replace the placeholder API key in the code with your own key.
4. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
5. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
6. Open your web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

Feel free to explore the code and customize the application as needed.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to NASA for providing access to their API and resources, making projects like this possible.

I'd like to acknowledge the React documentation, which served as a valuable resource during the development of this project.

Additionally, I'd like to acknowledge the valuable knowledge and skills I gained from my previous experience with a movie poster program learned in class, thanks to the guidance and teaching of my trainer, Tishana. This prior learning greatly contributed to the successful completion of this project.

This project was created as part of my journey to learn web development and explore new technologies.
